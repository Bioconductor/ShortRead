SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

NEW FEATURES

    o readXStringSet gets arguments skip, nrows; argument order
    changed slightly

    o New built-in SRFilters positionFilter, uniqueFilter to select
    reads aligning to particular positions, or to select only unique
    instances of reads aligning to each position.
    
    o readAligned gains a Solexa _results parser (_results files are
    liested as 'intermediate' in the Solexa manual, and not a good
    end-point for analysis)

    o readAligned gains a Bowtie output parser

    o readAligned gains ability to parse MAQ 0.7 version binary files

BUG FIXES

    o qa_solexa.Rnw incorrectly displayed read occurences when lanes
    were presented out-of-order (an unusual occurence)

    o readAligned SolexaAlign, etc., updated to parse 'chromsome' and
    'position', and 'strand' information correctly

    o readAligned MAQMapview failed for most chromosome labels

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o SRFilter allows construction of filters that can be used to
    subset existing data objects, or filter incoming (readAligned, at
    the moment) objects.

    o readAligned for Solexa-based alignments return 'strand'
    information as factor with levels "-", "+", "*" (strand not
    relevant), NA (no strand information available).

    o srorder, srsort, srrank, and srduplicated for AligendRead class
    now sort based on chromosome, strand, position AND sread; previous
    behavior can be recovers by extracting the sequences
    srsort(sread(aln)), etc.

    o Functions using SolexaPath now search all relevant directories,
    e.g., in analysisPath, rather than the first

NEW FEATURES


BUG FIXES

    o 'run' in eland_export files is correctly parsed as a factor
