<h2>Adapter Contamination</h2>
<p>
 Adapter contamination is defined here as 
 non-genetic sequences attached at either or both ends 
 of the reads. The 'contamination' measure is
 the number of reads with a right or left match to the adapter
 sequence over the total number of reads. Mismatch rates
 are 10\% on the left and 20\% on the right.
