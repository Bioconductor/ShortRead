<h2>Adapter Contamination</h2>
<a name="Adapter-Contamination"></a>

<p>
 Adapter contamination is defined here as non-genetic sequences
 attached at either or both ends of the reads. The 'contamination'
 measure is the number of reads with a right or left match to the
 adapter sequence over the total number of reads. Mismatch rates are
 10&#37; on the left and 20&#37; on the right with a minimum overlap
 of 10 nt.
