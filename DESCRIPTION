Description: This package implements sampling, iteration, and input of
        FASTQ files. The package includes functions for filtering and
        trimming reads, and for generating a quality assessment report.
        Data are represented as DNAStringSet-derived objects, and
        easily manipulated for a diversity of purposes.  The package
        also contains legacy support for early single-end, ungapped
        alignment formats.
