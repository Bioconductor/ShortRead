Description: This package implements sampling, iteration, and input of
    FASTQ files. The package includes functions for filtering and
    trimming reads, and for generating a quality assessment
    report. Data are represented as DNAStringSet-derived objects, and
    easily manipulated for a diversity of purposes.  The package also
    contains legacy support for early single-end, ungapped alignment
    formats.
